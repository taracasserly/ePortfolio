        Exercise 8.1: Weight Loss Data Analysis for Diet B
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To compare the weight loss effects of Diet B with Diet A and determine which diet is more effective based on sample mean and standard deviation.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Summary:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sample Size (n): 50 for both Diet A and Diet B.</li>
                    <li>Mean Weight Loss: 5.341 kg for Diet A, 3.710 kg for Diet B.</li>
                    <li>Standard Deviation (SD): 2.536 kg for Diet A, 2.769 kg for Diet B.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Results and Interpretation:</strong> The average weight loss for participants on Diet A is higher than that for Diet B, suggesting that Diet A might be more effective. The lower standard deviation for Diet A indicates a more consistent weight loss among participants compared to Diet B.</li>
            <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Diet A appears to be more effective in promoting weight loss, with higher mean weight loss and less variability among participants compared to Diet B.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Exercise 8.2: Central Tendency and Variability in Weight Loss Data for Diet B
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To analyse the central tendency and variability of weight loss data for Diet B and compare it with Diet A.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Summary:</strong> Median Weight Loss: 5.642 kg for Diet A, 3.745 kg for Diet B. First Quartile (Q1): 3.748 kg for Diet A, 1.953 kg for Diet B. Third Quartile (Q3): 7.033 kg for Diet A, 5.404 kg for Diet B. Interquartile Range (IQR): 3.285 kg for Diet A, 3.451 kg for Diet B.</li>
            <li><strong>Results and Interpretation:</strong> Diet A has a higher median weight loss, indicating that the median participant experienced more weight loss compared to Diet B. The first and third quartile data suggest that Diet A participants consistently experienced higher weight loss than those on Diet B. A slightly higher IQR for Diet B indicates a wider variability in weight loss among its participants.</li>
            <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Diet A demonstrates greater effectiveness in weight loss across various measures of central tendency and dispersion, showing both higher weight loss and consistency.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Exercise 8.3: Brand Preferences Across Two Demographic Areas
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To examine the brand preference for breakfast cereals between two demographic areas and understand the distribution of preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Summary and Comparative Analysis:</strong> Brand A has a higher percentage of preference in Area 2 compared to Area 1. Brand B also shows a marked increase in preference in Area 2. The 'Other' category is more dominant in Area 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Results and Interpretation:</strong> The data suggests a notable difference in brand preferences between the two areas, with Area 2 showing a stronger preference for specified brands over 'Other' brands.</li>
            <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The brand preference patterns indicate different consumer behaviours between the two areas. Further investigation into the cause of these differences could provide insights into market trends and brand performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Exercise 8.4: Analysis of Filtration Data
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The aim of this exercise is to determine whether there is a significant difference in the mean impurity levels between two filtration agents.</li>
            <li><strong>Hypotheses:</strong> Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the population mean impurity between the two filtration agents. Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a difference in the population mean impurity between the two filtration agents.</li>
            <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> A paired two-sample for means t-test was performed using the filtration data from Data Set G to compare the mean impurity levels of Agent1 and Agent2.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Summary:</strong> A brief summary of the data is presented, including the number of observations and the means and variances of the impurity levels for each agent.</li>
            <li><strong>Results:</strong> Mean Difference: -0.39, suggesting Agent1 has a lower mean impurity than Agent2. t-Statistic: -2.6367, indicating the mean difference is 2.6367 standard deviations away from the hypothesized mean difference of zero. Degrees of Freedom (df): 9, which is calculated based on the number of paired observations (10) minus 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The p-value is less than the alpha level of 0.05, which allows us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in mean impurity levels between the two agents. Given that the mean difference is negative, it can be interpreted that Agent1 typically has a lower level of impurities compared to Agent2, which may suggest higher effectiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The analysis provides evidence to support the claim that Agent1 and Agent2 have significantly different effects on impurity levels, with Agent1 being more effective at reducing impurities. This conclusion is made with a 95% confidence level, considering the statistical significance of the two-tailed test. However, it is recommended to consider the practical significance of the difference in means to make a final decision on the efficacy of the filtration agents.</li>
        </ul>
